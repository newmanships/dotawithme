       We are a couple of Dota fans that wanted an easy way to find people to play with that spoke English and wanted to communicate during matches.<br>
      We thought the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/compDota2">compDota2 subreddit</a> could be better so this is what came from it.
      <br>
      Some places we frequent include <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2">Learn Dota2</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2">Dota2 Subreddit</a>. Check them out!
