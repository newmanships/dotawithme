        <blockquote> June 5, 2014:  Thank you for looking around!  We have recently added Teams, Search, and Private Messages to our site.  While not perfect they will function for now.  You can also now edit your own profile!  In addition due to your requests we added an option for additional languages (this pertains mostly to non-Americans :P).  More things to come soon, thanks for visiting!

      <blockquote> We are a couple of Dota fans that wanted an easy way to find people to play with that spoke English and wanted to communicate during matches.<br>
      We thought the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/compDota2">compDota2 subreddit</a> could be better so this is what came from it.
